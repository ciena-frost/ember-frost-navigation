# 3.0.1
- Ability to add inline 'actions'
- Added ember block slots to blueprint


Usage:

```
this.action('Action 1', {
  action: 'myAction',
  pack: 'dummy',
  icon: 'sample',
  description: 'My description',
  inline: true
})
```

Where `inline: true` would determine whether it gets rendered in the actions tab or with the other apps.
